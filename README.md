Hi. I am Miko≈Çaj. And I refuse to keep being dehumanized, mocked and belittled by cold-blooded, insane employers from now on. I'm quitting trying to find a job. If years of my effort, stress, sleepless nights, anxiety and depression mean nothing in this system then I have no intention or incentive to to keep going. Goodbye.
